# Portfolio-Backtesting

### Description(Python, Yahoo Finance API, Pandas, Matplotlib)
This was one of my longest commission works so I decided to put it here. The job was to get stock recommendations from well known analysts and construct a portfolio that follows certain rules and consists of recommended stocks. Then to compare the portfolio of recommended stocks to a benchmark(S&P 500) by constructing a comparison graph. The yahoo finance API was used to get the prices of recommended stocks, then stocks were processed using pandas and the graph was made using matplotlib. 

### Potential Improvements
	Being one of my earlier works, it is written in intuitive style, hence implementing oop can greatly improve this project.
